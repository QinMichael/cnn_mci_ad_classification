The thesis research focus on investigating using CNNs to classify mild cognitive impairment and alzheimer's disease using 3D brain MRI images. 

There are two function files included: functions_preprocessing.py and functions_model.py. 
The functions_preprocessing file contains functions to preprocess MRI images, and the functions_model file contains functions needed for model training and testing.

The image preprocessing procedure is detailed in data_preprocessing.py file.

Model trainng and testing using four different methods (in total 16 models) is detailed in four files: models_baseline.py, models_da.py, models_tl.py and models_dr.py. Each file contains training and testing of four differnt models using one method.
